1. Initial implementation of Bridson's Poisson-disk sampling in functional now.

2. Worked on Body Field's code, though it's not complete yet.

3. Worked on using deep features with Vahid Kazemi's work.

4. Implemented a baseline classifier (a LinearSVM on simple hypercolumn features) and ran it on HPC. Memory is still a great issue and considering the simplicity of the baseline implementation, it will become a bigger issue later, when I try to use better feature vectors and larger models with more layers. Memory issue can be tackled in two ways:
	
	* Using blaze which can handle numpy arrays on hard disk instead of the memory. I'm not yet sure if this library can be used or how well will it perform, despite expecting it to be orders of magnitude slower compared to in-memory solution, it definitely is worth a shot.
	
	* Using SGD-based classifiers, so that features would only be copied into memory when they are needed.
	
5. I don't quite remember what else have I done this week :D
