1. Watched Lecture 1 and 2 of Nando de Freitas's Deep Learning course in Oxford.
2. Installed Torch7 and related Deep Learning packages in Ubuntu VM
3. Searched for ways to convert Caffe trained models to model file which could be used in Theano and/or related Libraries.
4. Created an issue in Lasagne asking about converting models. sklearn-theano has a converter and started on running this code without Caffe installed.
