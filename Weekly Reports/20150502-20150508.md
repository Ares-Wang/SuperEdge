1. Data loading implementation is final. I think it would suite well for what I want to do.
2. I have started implementing the feature extraction code. The code will parse the VGG 16 model, and then it will transform the image into features. This feature extractor will only output image activations for conv and pooling layers. Since I want to experiment with multiple pixel-wise feature extraction ideas from layer activations, this feature extractor won't output pixel-wise features. It will only output extracted features for image as a whole.
3. Caffe is finally installed in university's computer.
4. I am in the midst of studying these papers:
	* Holistically-Nested Edge Detection
	* High-for-Low and Low-for-High: Efficient Boundary Detection from Deep Object and its Applications to High-Level Vision
	* HypercolumnsforObjectSegmentationandFine-grainedLocalization
	* Semantic Contours from Inverse Detectors
5. So far I am behind my schedule, I should speed things up.
