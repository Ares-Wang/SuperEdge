1. GoogLeNet using sklearn-theano is working now.
2. I created a pull request implementing VGG CNN S caffemodel in sklearn-theano. It has been submitted, but has not yet been reviewed and still seems to have problems. I plan to implement VGG ILSVRC 2014 19 layer model and also AlexNet model, and layer maybe NIN model in sklearn-theano.
3. The alexnet-theano project has provided its binary trained model weights. Still have to figure out how to use it. 
4. Blog post on installing theano on Windows has gathered some attention.
5. Happy Nowruz :)
