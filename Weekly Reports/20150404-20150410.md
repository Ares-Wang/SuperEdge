1. I watched and studied Lecture 3, 4 and 5 of Oxford Deep Learning.
2. I described my state of research to Dr. Kasaei in the IPLab weekly group meeting this Wednesday
3. I posted a ticket on problem with using cuDNN v2 in Theano on Windows ([link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/theano-users/rxmKifu9tAQ)). After discussions with nouiz, I applied his suggestion to try this [PR](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/2680/), I did and it solved the problem. Now cuDNN v2 is functional and working. I will check if this PR is going to be merged to the master branch.
4. This week, task description and data for **Data Mining Cup 2015** was released. Should figure out something next week when we are going to have a meeting with Dr. Soleymani.
