I talked with Dr. Soleymani about research project on CNNs for Contour Detection. After some discussion, we came to a conclusion to find another research topic for my bachelor's thesis and as a summer project. Instead I should try to complete work on CNNs for Contour Detection in a month (before Khordad 1st, before the last week of May). After that I should immediately take the thesis course for summer and start working on the new project.

After talking with Mr. Souri, he agreed on helping me finishing the work on CNNs for Contour Detection as fast as possible.
