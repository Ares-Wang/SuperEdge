1. Read paper titled "Contour Detection using Cost-sensitive Convolutional Neural Networks"
2. Contacted one of the mentioned paper's authors to notify him about an error in their paper. He told me that it would be fixed by Friday, but it hasn't yet been fixed.
3. Nothing special happened in the IPL group meeting. Dr. Kasaei was low on time, so no one reported on their research progress.
4. This is it all.
