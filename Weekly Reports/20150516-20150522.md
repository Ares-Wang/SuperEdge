1. Huge amount of time was spent on completing the DMC 2015 task, though no success was apparent.

2. I also spent a sizeable amount of time helping Miss Ershadi complete and debug her implementation.

3. I tested the current feature extraction implementation using VGG CNN F pre-trained model, and there were no problems detected. The only issue is that this model normalizes input using mean image, which makes problems when trying to obtain a sub-network that is not dependent on the size of the input image. My first idea is to resize the mean image to match that of the input image and then trasform the input image accordingly.

4. I researched about and started implementing _Bradson's Poisson-disk sampling algorithm_, though implementation isn't final yet.

5. I have missed the first deadline, with no results achieved so far. I have to cocentrate more on my project.
