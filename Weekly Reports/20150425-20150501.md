1. Start adding quality assessment metrics implementation. I'm currently converting MATLAB implementation to Python, though MATLAB uses C++ implementations for performance-heavy parts. I either have to implement a Python wrapper around the C++ implementations or recreate them in Python. 

2. I read "Visual Boundary Prediction" paper. It was a great read. I have put review and summary in the _Paper_ section.

3. After having several discussions with Mr. Souri regarding the applications of boundary prediction and state of the field, Mr. Souri suggested an idea, a great one, semantic or object specific boundary prediction. This looks like an awesome idea with lots of applications, though execution is what matters the most. I gave a hint about this new idea to Dr. Soleymani and she seemed to get excited. However, extensive discussion with her will be conducted next week in a meeting.

4. Three new papers this week, each becoming state-of-the-art one after the other. Current state-of-the-art is "Holistically-nested Edge Detection".

5. We had a great and memorable Teacher's day ceremony this week. I totally liked it :)
