I have three main lines for the research:
1. Use a pre-trained Neural Net to extract pixel-wise features and use those features to train a simpler model for classification (CRF, SVM)
2. Train an end-to-end CNN for contour detection
3. Use the idea of conditional adversarial generative networks to train a contour generator model
