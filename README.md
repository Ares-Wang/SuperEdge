# SuperEdge
It was a research project that I was interested in working on. After making a little progress, I hit the wall on hardware resource limitations. Additionally, I was bombarded with new papers week by week becoming the state-of-the-art in supervised edge detection, last one being the [Holisticaly-nested Edge Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06375) completely [crushing the competitions](https://github.com/erfannoury/SuperEdge/blob/master/Thesis%20Report/BenchmarkResults.md) (last year's competition, though) :D

Due to these problems, and the fact that I was working on other research projects, I stopped working on this project. However, after skimming through recent submission to CVPR 2016 and ICLR 2016, I'm seeing new datasets and a new-born interest in this problem. This had made me think twice about this project and I think I'll be resuming work on **SuperEdge** in the (hopefully) near future.
